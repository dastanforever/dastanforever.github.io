<strong>** I will also write a post in TMB regarding the algorithm. **</strong><br>
KMP algorithm is one of the famous algorithms for pattern matching. And I had to find a lot of resources to find what all was happening
in the algorithm, and when I finally understood it, I had to give a try to the implementation of the algo. Since KMP works in a DFA fashion, it was easy to integrate it into system which reads a large file in a window, character by character updating it (saves a lot of memory), and thscans the window to change states of the DFA array of KMP. Hence it performs well and produces faster results than native grep in a specific case of displaying before and after characters of the pattern.

The following code is the computation function of KMP, which populated the kmp array.
