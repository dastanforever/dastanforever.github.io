This was made when I was learning about networking, and NodeJS. Though there were several frameworks like - <a href="socket.io"> socket.io</a>, 
I wanted to implement things in the app from native http modules of Nodejs. After which I also made the different TCP protocols in our
 networking class using python.

This repo contains the nodejs application code which can run on any platform and users can chat on a local network. What I like about this app
is that the working (or building up of the network of users) can be explained by simple Mathematical Induction, which I would describe in TMB.
