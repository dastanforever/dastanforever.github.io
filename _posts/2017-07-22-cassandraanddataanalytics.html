Most recently I was working with analytics, and hence I decided to write what I learnt from my experience. Though it took
more time than it should have, I learnt many new things too. Let me start with Python. I will keep this post short and concise,
but will give the links to learn more.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Python Generators and Iterators</h3>
In python, I always wanted to use generators myself. For me it was a big aim :D, cause I never got the chance to work on this much big amount of data.
So, the data was to be taken from database, and then pushed to cassandra for displaying analytics (which it is famous for).
To write data, I had to perform batch insert operations but with a batch size. So, I iterated over the records with an iterator
and the structure of the code was as follows - 


<br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/phraniiac/3743d615174fe301c6df2d4f56884e32.js"></script>
<br>
Yeah, I know thats not too cool, and maybe pretty naive, but it would help me actually improve memory performance of the insertion 
script. One thing that was new to realize with this code was, when I tried it with the following code, only one of the table had
the data and the other ones were empty. This made me realize that the function which is iterating over the elements of the batch 
should be called for ech table because once a yielded object is iterated, it goes out of memory. So I chaned the structure of the
code and called the function for all the tables. The number of queries remained the same, the memory load at a time was same too.
If you think I could have done it in a better way, comment below and we would discuss.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Cassandra</h3>
Moving on to the next part, which is cassandra. Cassandra is a columnar database which is highly write efficient. And while
learning about cassandra I came across many concepts, like the hierarchial primary keys, CAP theorem, redundant data storage.
<br>
<br>
First of all, it is a good practice to store redundant data to cassandra, because it is really good at writing data in database.
Write everything that you would need to get instantly for usage.Also consider the following image, and start thinking in columnar
ways because that will help in designing the structure of tables and also decide the primary keys.
<br>
<br>
First lets discuss the different type of keys in cassandra.
<ol>
      <li>
            <b>Partition Key</b> - They decide on which node the record will be stored.
      </li>
      <li>
            <b>Clustering Key</b> - They decide the ordering of the records to be stored in a particular node, based on the columns that 
            are included.
      </li>
</ol>

So, from all that I learnt(yet), I think I can summarize the workflow of a developer using cassandra for basic dashboard analytics
as follows - 

<ol>
      <li>
            Preprocess all the analytics you want to show. Use pandas/spark anything.
      </li>
      <li>
            Model the queries you want to run in cassandra.
      </li>
      <li>
            Group the queries with most column name which are present in the where clause. Those queries can be run on a single table
            by making that column name as partition key(the first level key). 
      </li>
      <li>
            Insert the data, and perform the queries. It is recommeded to use the partition key as more as you can in selecting queries.
      </li>
</ol>

This is the gitbook I found most useful for learning cassandra. Check it for more details. The link for all other sources are in the sidebar.
The last thing about cassandra is this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/34287675" target="blank">stackoverflow answer</a>. This is really peculiar/interesting as it helps to gain insight of how cassandra
is working.
