Used basic BFS, BeautifulSoup, Google App Engine to make this. On its way, learned many things like -
     <ol>
       <li>Unix Environment Variables</li>
       <li>Python Comprehensions</li>
       <li>Virtual machines</li>
       <li>Hosting</li>
       <li>Amazon AWS</li>
     </ol>
Though small, it took me a long time to complete this. I searched for Google app engine proxy fix, 
understood how hosting and virtual machines on the cloud worked. Understood basics of html, css, and javascript.
