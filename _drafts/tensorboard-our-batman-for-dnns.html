So, the first tensorflow dev summit was over, and the biggest news was Version 1.0, with all these new features. One of them which caught
my eye was TensorBoard. Well the speaker summarized it best as -

<type2>Overview</type2><br>
In this tutorial I will present some things that I can make tensorboard do ;). If you know about tensorboard, and are here to code, skip this
section.So, lets talk more about tensorboard. Tensorboard is a tool that can help us visualize summaries of variables, the graph, and 
embeddings (t-SNE, and PCA). And to make it do that, we have to follow these steps - 
<ol>
    <li>Make a <code>FileWriter Object</code>. It is responsible for writing data onto hard disks.</li>
    <li>Use <code>tf.summary</code> module for recording different summaries.</li>
    <li>Make a tensor of merged summaries, using <code>merge_all_summaries</code> method, and then evaluate using the session object at some intervals in training.</li>
    <li>Write that summary to the filewrite object using <code>add_summary</code> method.</li>
    <li>Write out the graph to the object using <code>add_graph</code> method.</li>
</ol>

<type2>Lets get started</type2><br>
So with that, lets begin to try our hands on the tool. Since while writing, I am a newbie to tensorflow myself, I would start with simplest tensor computations
 and then proceed to a proper neural network. Lets start with the following code, which has 2 layers, one of them calculates the mean and also multiplies the
 input vector by 10, and nested layer calculates the sum of the product.

<type3>Some more Info</type3><br>
With this I think we get a pretty nice idea of what's happening under the hood. We name the variables, we get the results. Now what are all the type of data that can
be displayed or kept track of, should be our concern. I think it would be pretty interesting to see the mean of weights during a training of model, and we can do that
just the way we did now. Below is a list of possible summaries that can be written - 
<ol>
    <li>Scalars - One valued constants.</li>
    <li>Audio</li>
    <li>Image</li>
    <li>Histogram</li>
</ol>

<type2>One complete Example</type2><br>
This would be the final example, an I would like to cover as many aspects of the module as possible. Also since I am closely following the Stanford cs224n course(2017
version), the coding style and moreover the format is highly related to that. It might seem a bit fuzzy at once, but it is maintable code :). I would like to highlight
some practices I think would be good to maintain for summaries and training models, like during epochs, record them, in cycle of 5 and others, still, leave feedbacks
for improvements.
